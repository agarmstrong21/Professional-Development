What Part of the project are you currently working on?
    I have finished Part 0 + 1 so far. I will continue working on Part 2 at a later date.


What can you do to be successful at this project?
    Work on this early, make sure you have enough time for questions, but don't over stress yourself.



What can we do to help you be successful at this project?
    Possibly make this a little longer homework. I understand we are given about a week and a half already, but
    keep in mind we are taking our midterm this friday, Application Activity, and a Lab all in a week. I love the work
    but I do have many other classes too. Right now this is fine, but keep in mind for the future. Thank you much
